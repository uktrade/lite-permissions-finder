  Based on your answers, either:
</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet text">
  <li>you don't need a licence to import your items, or</li>
  <li>you haven't been able to identify the correct item in this service</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you export your item without a licence, you will still be responsible for any penalties incurred if it's later established the export did need a licence.
