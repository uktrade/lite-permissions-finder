<p>
  You cannot use this service to get an export licence. This is because either:
</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet text">
  <li>you do not need a licence to export your items, or</li>
  <li>you have not been able to identify the correct item in this service</li>
</ul>

<p>
  It's not possible to say for certain that you do not need a licence - it is still your responsibility to make sure.
</p>

<p>
  If you haven't been able to identify your item but you still think you may need a licence, you should contact the Export Control Organisation (ECO) to discuss your export. You can contact them by telephone on 020 7215 4594, or by email at <a href="mailto:eco.help@trade.gsi.gov.uk">eco.help@trade.gsi.gov.uk</a>.

  End-use controls
</h2>

<p>
  You cannot export your item without a licence if either of the following is true:
</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet text">
  <li>you know or suspect that your item will be used in a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programme or delivery system</li>
  <li>you are exporting dual-use items that do not usually need an export licence, but you know or suspect that they might be incorporated into military equipment for use in an embargoed country</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You must contact the ECO to discuss your export in each of these cases.

  Sanctions and embargoes

<p>
  You should also check that no sanctions or embargoes apply to your export destination. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/business/imports-exports" class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">See a list of embargoed countries</a>.
