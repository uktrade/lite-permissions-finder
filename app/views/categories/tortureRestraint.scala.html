    <p>
      You can export some goods that could be used for torture but that also have legitimate applications. If you think this may apply to your goods, or you are not sure, <button type="submit" class="link underlined font-small" role="link" name="action" value="goToSearch">use the search facility</button> to check whether your goods can be licensed for export.
