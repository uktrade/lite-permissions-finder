    You have not found your item in the UK Military List. This does not mean that your item is not controlled.
  </p>

  <div class="banner danger-banner">
    <span class="visually-hidden">Warning:</span>
    Always double-check if your items are controlled. If you export controlled items without the correct export licence
    you could:
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>have your items seized</li>
      <li>face a fine</li>
      <li>serve up to 10 years in prison</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 class="heading-large">What you should do next</h2>

  <ol class="circle-step-list">
    <li>
      Get someone who knows the technical details of your details of your item to help you check the choices you've
      made against the technical specifications of your item.
    </li>
    <li>
      Go back to verify the type of item and which category it falls under within the UK Military List.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider whether your item is specially designed for military use or not. If your item is not military than you
      should consider the dual use list.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="heading-large">Export control licenses</h2>

  <p>You cannot export items without a licence if:</p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>you know or suspect they'll be used in a weapons of mass destruction programme or delivery system (also known
      as 'end-use controls')</li>
    <li>you're exporting dual-use items that do not usually need an export licence but you know or suspect they might
      be incorporated into military equipment for use in embargoed countries</li>
    <li>there are embargoes, sanctions or other restrictions which cover your export destination</li>
  </ul>
