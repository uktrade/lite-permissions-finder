<h1 class="heading-large">You may not need an import licence</h1>

<p>You only need a licence to import iron and steel if the materials are being sent from Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>
  If you export your item without a licence, you will still be responsible for any penalties incurred if it's later established the export did need a licence.
