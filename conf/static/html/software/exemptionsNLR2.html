  You don't need a licence to export:
</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet text">
  <li>software that is available for the public to buy from shops, online stores or other retail outlets</li>
  <li>software that the user can install themselves, without your help</li>
  <li>compiled source code that is the minimum needed to install, operate, maintain or repair exported items</li>
</ul>

<p>
  It's not possible for this service to say for certain that you donâ€™t need a licence - it is still your responsibility to make sure.
</p>

<p>
  If you still think you may need a licence, you should contact the Export Control Organisation (ECO) to discuss your export. You can contact them by telephone on 020 7215 4594, or by email at <a href="mailto:eco.help@beis.gsi.gov.uk">eco.help@beis.gsi.gov.uk</a>.

  End-use controls
</h2>

<p>
  You cannot export your item without a licence if either of the following is true:
<p/>

<ul class="list list-bullet text">
  <li>you know or suspect that your item will be used in a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programme or delivery system</li>
  <li>you are exporting dual-use items that do not usually need an export licence, but you know or suspect that they might be incorporated into military equipment for use in an embargoed country</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You must contact the ECO to discuss your export in each of these cases.
