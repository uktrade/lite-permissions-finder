<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What you should do next</h2>

<ol class="circle-step-list">
	<li>
		Get someone who knows the technical details of your details of your item to help you check the choices you've
		made against the technical specifications of your item.
	</li>
	<li>
		Go back to verify the type of item and which category it falls under within the UK Military List.
	</li>
	<li>
		Consider whether your item is specially designed for military use or not. If your item is not military than you
		should consider the dual use list.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Export control licenses</h2>

<p class="govuk-label">You cannot export items without a licence if:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li>you know or suspect they'll be used in a weapons of mass destruction programme or delivery system (also known
		as 'end-use controls')</li>
	<li>you're exporting dual-use items that do not usually need an export licence but you know or suspect they might
		be incorporated into military equipment for use in embargoed countries</li>
	<li>there are embargoes, sanctions or other restrictions which cover your export destination</li>
