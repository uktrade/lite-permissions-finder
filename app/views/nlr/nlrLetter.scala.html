  <p>
    Dear @userDetailsView.getTitle @userDetailsView.getLastName
  </p>

  <p>
    Based on the choices you made on the online tool, the item does not currently require an export licence.
  </p>

  <p>
    This assessment is made taking into account the choices you made on the online tool and the legislation in force at
    the date of this letter.
  </p>

  <p>
    However this could change if, before the export takes place, there are changes to the legislation (including
    country sanctions) or information becomes available, either to you or to the Export Control Organisation (ECO),
    which suggests that an end-use control may be applicable. Therefore ECO cannot fully guarantee that your export can
    proceed.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, ECO cannot comment on any action Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) may wish to take at the point
    of export, since HMRC have a legal obligation to verify export declarations and undertake examination of either
    documents or goods where there are doubts about whether a prohibition or restriction may apply.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moreover ECO cannot comment on any action that the Customs Authority in another EU Member State may wish to take at
    the point of export for goods located outside of the UK.
  </p>

  <p>
    We therefore advise that if, at any time from the date of this letter you have grounds for suspecting the items in
    the Schedule are intended for Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) purposes (as further explained below) and/or if
    there is a considerable delay between the date of this letter and the date of export, then you should make an
    End-User Advice Enquiry on SPIRE for an up-to-date re-assessment of the end-users for which the export is intended.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that ECO will not offer compensation for any loss of business as a result of exercising its statutory
    functions to make export licence decisions. We would only consider cases where it can be shown that there has been
    negligence or maladministration by Her Majesty's Government (HMG).
  </p>

  <p>
    You are strongly encouraged to carefully consider this letter and regularly check the information on our web pages
    about current export control requirements, details of which are set out in the following paragraphs.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Sanctions</h2>
  <p>
    For general advice on current embargoes and restrictions (including information on embargoed destinations and scope
    of the sanctions), see:
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/sanctions-embargoes-and-restrictions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/sanctions-embargoes-and-restrictions</a>
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">End-Use Controls</h2>
  <p>
    You will also need to be aware of the end-use controls and how they may apply to the items you intend to export.
    For information and guidance on the operation of the WMD and Military End-Use Controls, and an explanation of the
    legal responsibilities of exporters under those controls, see:
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-military-or-dual-use-goods-services-or-technology-special-rules" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-military-or-dual-use-goods-services-or-technology-special-rules</a> and
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/military-end-use-control-guidance-notes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/military-end-use-control-guidance-notes</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    As explained in the guidance, if now, or at any time in the future, you become aware or have any grounds for
    suspecting that the items you wish to export might be used in any way in connection with nuclear, chemical or
    biological weapons, or missiles to deliver them, as set out in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009, as
    amended, and/or Articles 6, 7 and 8 of the Export Control Order 2008 (WMD purposes), then you should tell us of the
    circumstances and apply for a licence.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Restrictions not operated by the Export Control Organisation</h2>
  <p>
    This application has not been assessed against other restrictions on exports (for example on antique goods or
    pharmaceutical products) not administered by ECO. For further details of these restrictions, please see:
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/starting-to-export" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/starting-to-export</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition you should be aware that there are significant restrictions on the transfer of funds and making economic
    resources available (including the supply of goods) to persons, entities or bodies which are listed in the EU
    sanctions legislation in respect of countries subject to UN or EU sanctions. Up-to-date details of these can be found
    in the Notices issued by HM Treasury which are posted in the web-link below. In addition, the UK financial sanctions
    against embargoed destinations are regularly reviewed and tightened by means of legislation issued by HM Treasury.
    These may include prohibitions on all financial transactions and business relationships between UK financial and
    credit institutions and banks incorporated in countries which are subject to sanctions. Whilst this legislation
    affects financial and credit institutions and does not directly restrict exports, it could make it harder for you to
    trade with the relevant embargoed destination/s, as your bank may not be able to handle payments from or to banks in
    the countries subject to these financial restrictions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Full details on the financial restrictions can be found on HMT's Asset Freezing Unit webpage:
    <a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/fin_sanctions_index.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/fin_sanctions_index.htm</a>
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Where to find further information</h2>
  <p>
    It is the responsibility of exporters to consult the current export control legislation, familiarise themselves
    with export controls and make their own evaluation of the need for export licences.
  </p>

  <p>
    For general information on strategic export controls see:
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/beginners-guide-to-export-controls" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/beginners-guide-to-export-controls</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, if you require further advice regarding the measures referred to in this letter, including how any
    relevant export control legislation may apply to your particular case, we recommend that you seek independent legal
    advice.
  </p>

  <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

  <p class="bold">Export Control Organisation</p>
