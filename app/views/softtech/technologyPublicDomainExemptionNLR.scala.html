      Based on your answers, either:
    </p>

    <ul class="list list-bullet text">
      <li>you don't need a licence to export your items, or</li>
      <li>you haven't been able to identify the correct item in this service</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you are exporting nuclear technology for patent applications, you should <button type="submit" class="link underlined font-small" name="action" value="continue">continue to use this service</button>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you export your item without a licence, you will still be responsible for any penalties incurred if it's later established the export did need a licence.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you still think you may need a licence, you should contact the Export Control Organisation (ECO) to discuss your export. You can contact them by telephone on 020 7215 4594, or by email at <a href="mailto:eco.help@@trade.gsi.gov.uk">eco.help@@trade.gsi.gov.uk</a>.

      End-use controls
    </h2>

    <p>
      You cannot export your item without a licence if either of the following is true:
    <p/>

    <ul class="list list-bullet text">
      <li>you know or suspect that your item will be used in a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programme or delivery system</li>
      <li>you are exporting dual-use items that do not usually need an export licence, but you know or suspect that they might be incorporated into military equipment for use in an embargoed country</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You must contact the ECO to discuss your export in each of these cases.
