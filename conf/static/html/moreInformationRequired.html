<p>
  Based on the choice you've made, you need to find out more about your item.
</p>

<div class="banner danger-banner">
  <span class="visually-hidden">Warning:</span>
  Always double-check if your items are controlled. If you export controlled items without the correct export licence
  you could:
  <ul class="list list-bullet">
	<li>have your items seized</li>
	<li>face a fine</li>
	<li>serve up to 10 years in prison</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2 class="heading-large">What you should do next</h2>

<ol class="circle-step-list">
  <li>
    Get a technical expert who understands your item's design and technical specifications to check if your item:
    <ul class="list list-bullet text">
      <li>is specially designed or modified for a military application (also known as military use)</li>
      <li>is defined as a component, software or technology</li>
      <li>needs to be checked against another one of the UK Strategic Export Control Lists</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you don't have a technical expert to help you then read the following guidance on the GOV.UK website:
    <ul class="list list-bullet text">
