  You may need an import licence if the species is non-native

<p>
  You normally don't need a licence to import non-endangered live animals. You must however make sure that you follow
  animal welfare regulations in full at all times.
</p>

<p>
  You do need a licence to import any non-native animal to the UK -

     class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">apply using form RM01</a>.
  Read guidance on
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-non-native-animals"
     class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">importing non-native animals</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Non-native animals may also be covered by the Balai Directive. Read about the
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/balai-directive-moving-live-animals-semen-and-embryos"
     class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">requirements of the Directive</a> and see a list of
  <a href="http://www.nonnativespecies.org/factsheet/index.cfm"
     class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">what counts as a non-native species</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Some live animals and birds are covered by a general import licence. See a
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-live-animals-or-animal-products-from-non-eu-countries-general-licences-and-authorisations#live-animals"
     class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">list of general licences for live animals and birds</a>. You can use a general licence without applying for it, but
  you must follow all the conditions in the licence.
</p>

<p>
  If you need a licence but no current licence exists, you should contact the Animal and Plant Health Agency by email at
  <a href="mailto:imports@apha.gsi.gov.uk">imports@apha.gsi.gov.uk</a> or by phone on 03000 200 301.

     class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">apply for an individual licence</a> using form IV58, but you should contact the APHA first.
  Some animals, such as rodents, lagomorphs and most exotic mammals, need a specific licence.
