  <h3 class="heading-small">Animal products</h3><br>

  You need a licence to import certain products of animal origin. If a general licence for your product already exists,
  you can use this to import your items.

     class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">
    See a list</a> of existing general import licences for animal products.
  You can use a general licence without applying for it, but you must follow all the conditions in the licence.
</p>
<p>
  If the general licence you need doesnâ€™t exist, you must apply for a specific licence for that product using

<h3 class="heading-small">Organic produce</h3><br>


  You must register with an organic control body if you want to produce, prepare, store or market organic produce from
  outside the EU.
  You must get a Certificate of Inspection (CoI) for your import from the control body before goods arrive in the UK.

  You can decide which body to register with based on your needs.
