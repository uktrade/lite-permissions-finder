  <p>
    Some things exported for civilian purposes can also have a military use and therefore need a licence. They are typically high-tech, advanced products, often with military standard specifications. These are called dual-use items.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many items you might not think need a licence may in fact have a dual use, such as:
    <ul class="list list-bullet text">
      <li>protective suits, gloves and shoes</li>
      <li>machine tools</li>
      <li>computers</li>
      <li>capacitors</li>
      <li>microchips</li>
      <li>telecommunications equipment</li>
      <li>underwater equipment</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    There are many other examples of dual-use items, and not all of the items listed above will require a licence. Watch a short video about dual-use items: <a href="#">[video]</a>

  <form action="@DualUseController.handleSubmit()" method="POST">

    @formRadioBoolean(form("isDualUse"), Html("Could your items be dual use?"))

    <div class="form-group">
      @detailPanel("im-not-sure") { I'm not sure } {
        If there is a chance your items are dual use, you should choose <span class="bold-small">Yes</span> above and continue to find out whether you need a licence.
      }
