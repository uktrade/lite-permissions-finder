<p>
  You may need a licence or other permissions depending on where you are sending or taking your items.
</p>


<h2 class="heading-medium">Exporting within the EU</h2>

<p>
  You need a European Firearms Pass (EFP) to take the following items to another EU country for personal use:
</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet text">
  <li>firearms</li>
  <li>shotguns</li>
  <li>related ammunition</li>
  <li>sights using non-electronic image enhancement</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The EFP acts as proof that you can legally possess firearms and ammunition in the EU.
  To get an EFP you will need to have a valid UK firearm or shotgun certificate. An EFP is provided free of charge.
</p>

<p>
  For temporary exports, you do not need any other type of licence to take or send non-military firearms and related ammunition to another EU country.
  If you are exporting your items permanently, you will need to find out from your local police authority whether you need an export licence
  (you will be told this when you apply for the EFP).

<p>You must have a valid UK firearm or shotgun certificate, or visitor's firearm or shotgun permit.
  It must identify your items and must be presented at the place of export.</p>
