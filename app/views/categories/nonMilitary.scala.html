  <p>
    If you have a valid UK firearm or shotgun certificate, you donâ€™t normally need an export licence to take or send the following items overseas:
  </p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet text">
    <li>firearms</li>
    <li>shotguns</li>
    <li>related ammunition</li>
    <li>sights using non-electronic image enhancement</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A European Firearms Pass (EFP) acts as proof that you can legally possess firearms and ammunition in the EU. You can normally use an EFP to temporarily or permanently export items outside of the EU.
