<h1 class="heading-large">No licence available</h1>

<p>
  You cannot use this service to get an import licence. This is because either:

<ul class="list list-bullet text">
  <li>you do not need a licence to import your items, or</li>
  <li>you have not been able to identify the correct item in this service</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
It's not possible to say for certain that you do not need a licence - it is still your responsibility to make sure.
</p>

<p>
If you still think you may need a licence, or for further advice on import controls, you can contact the
  Import Licensing Branch
  by email <a href="mailto:enquiries.ilb@trade.gsi.gov.uk">enquiries.ilb@trade.gsi.gov.uk</a> or by phone on 01642 364333.
