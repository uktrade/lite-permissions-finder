  <h3 class="heading-small">Animal products</h3><br>

  You need a licence to import certain products of animal origin. If a general licence for your product already exists,
  you can use this to import your items. See a list of
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-live-animals-or-animal-products-from-non-eu-countries-general-licences-and-authorisations#products-for-human-consumption"
     class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">existing general import licences for animal products</a>.
  You can use a general licence without applying for it, but you must follow all the conditions in the licence.
</p>
<p>
  If the general licence you need doesnâ€™t exist, you must apply for a specific licence for that product using

  fruit or vegetables. PEACH can help you fulfil a number of important requirements, including plant health requirements.

<h3 class="heading-small">Organic produce</h3><br>

  You must register with an organic control body if you want to produce, prepare, store or market organic produce from
  outside the EU. You must get a Certificate of Inspection (CoI) for your import from the control body before goods arrive in the UK.
  You can decide which body to register with based on your needs. See a list of
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/organic-certification-list-of-uk-approved-organic-control-bodies"
