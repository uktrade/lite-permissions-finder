  As you are exporting specific dual-use items to another EU country, you do not need an export licence. Most dual-use items can be moved freely within the EU.
</p>

<p>
  You must follow these rules when moving dual-use items within the EU:
</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet text">
  <li>Keep documentation, eg sales contracts, order confirmations and invoices, for at least three years from the end of the calendar year in which a transfer of items took place</li>
  <li>Indicate on all documentation that the items would require a licence if exported from the EU</li>
  <li>Produce documentation to authorities on request</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You can contact the Export Control Organisation, by email at <a href="mailto:eco.help@bis.gsi.gov.uk">eco.help@bis.gsi.gov.uk</a> or by phone on 020 7215 4594, if you still think you might need a licence.
