  You don't need a licence to export software that is in the public domain, for example software that is freely and legally available to download from a public website.
</p>

<p>
  If you export your item without a licence, you will still be responsible for any penalties incurred if it's later established the export did need a licence.
</p>

<p>
  If you still think you may need a licence, you should contact the Export Control Organisation (ECO) to discuss your export. You can contact them by telephone on 020 7215 4594, or by email at <a href="mailto:eco.help@trade.gsi.gov.uk">eco.help@trade.gsi.gov.uk</a>.

  End-use controls
</h2>

<p>
  You cannot export your item without a licence if either of the following is true:
<p/>

<ul class="list list-bullet text">
  <li>you know or suspect that your item will be used in a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programme or delivery system</li>
  <li>you are exporting dual-use items that do not usually need an export licence, but you know or suspect that they might be incorporated into military equipment for use in an embargoed country</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You must contact the ECO to discuss your export in each of these cases.

  Sanctions and embargoes

<p>
  You should also check that no sanctions or embargoes apply to your export destination. See a list of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/current-arms-embargoes-and-other-restrictions" class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">current arms embargoes and other restrictions</a>.
