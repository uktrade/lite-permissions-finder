  You need a licence to import certain products of animal origin
</h1>
<br>

<p>
  If a general licence for your product already exists, you can use this to import your items. See a list of
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-live-animals-or-animal-products-from-non-eu-countries-general-licences-and-authorisations#products-not-for-human-consumption"
     class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">existing general import licences for non-food animal products</a> , and for
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-live-animals-or-animal-products-from-non-eu-countries-general-licences-and-authorisations#genetic-material"
     class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">genetic material</a>.
<p>
  You can use a general licence without applying for it, but you must follow all the conditions in the licence.
</p>

<p>
  If the general licence you need doesnâ€™t exist, you must apply for a specific licence for that product using
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/animal-products-and-pathogens-application-for-import-licence"
     class="external" rel="external" target="_blank">
    form IV58 or IV59</a>.

<p>
  You may also need to inform Defra in advance of certain products' arrival in the UK, such as fertilisers and manure.
</p>
