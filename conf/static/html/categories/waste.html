  Notification controls

  You need the consent of destination countries to export waste considered high risk. This consent is called a notification control.

  Green-list waste
</h2>

<p>
  Green-list waste is usually considered a low risk to the environment. You can export green-list waste without permission in most cases. You must follow all import rules of the destination country and it is your responsibility to check all the requirements that apply there.
