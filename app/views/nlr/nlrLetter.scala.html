  Dear @userDetailsView.getTitle @userDetailsView.getLastName
</p>

<p class="bold">
  Reference Code: @resumeCode
</p>

<p>
  Based on the choices you made in the online service - as shown in the Schedule of Goods below - the item does not
  currently require an export licence.
</p>

<p>
  This assessment is made taking into account the choices you made on the online tool and the legislation in force at
  the date of this letter.
</p>

<p>
  However this could change if, before the export takes place, there are changes to the legislation (including
  country sanctions) or information becomes available, either to you or to the Export Control Organisation (ECO),
  which suggests that an end-use control may be applicable. Therefore ECO cannot fully guarantee that your export can
  proceed.
</p>

<p>
  In addition, ECO cannot comment on any action Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) may wish to take at the point
  of export, since HMRC have a legal obligation to verify export declarations and undertake examination of either
  documents or goods where there are doubts about whether a prohibition or restriction may apply.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover ECO cannot comment on any action that the Customs Authority in another EU Member State may wish to take at
  the point of export for goods located outside of the UK.
</p>

<p>
  We therefore advise that if, at any time you have grounds for suspecting the items in the Schedule are intended for
  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) purposes (as further explained below), then you should make an End-User Advice
  Enquiry on SPIRE for an assessment of the end-users for which the export is intended.
</p>

<p>
  Please note that ECO will not offer compensation for any loss of business as a result of exercising its statutory
  functions to make export licence decisions. We would only consider cases where it can be shown that there has been
  negligence or maladministration by Her Majesty's Government (HMG).
</p>

<p>
  You are strongly encouraged to carefully consider this letter and regularly check the information on our web pages
  about current export control requirements, details of which are set out in the following paragraphs.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Sanctions</h2>
<p>
  Learn more about
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/sanctions-embargoes-and-restrictions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sanctions and embargoes</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This general advice includes information on embargoed destinations and scope of sanctions.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">End-Use Controls</h2>
<p>
  You will also need to be aware of the end-use controls and how they may apply to the items you intend to export.
</p>
<p>
  See information and guidance on
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/export-military-or-dual-use-goods-services-or-technology-special-rules" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WMD and military end-use controls</a> and
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/military-end-use-control-guidance-notes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the legal responsibilities of exporters under those controls</a>.
</p>

<p>
  As explained in the guidance, if now, or at any time in the future, you become aware or have any grounds for
  suspecting that the items you wish to export might be used in any way in connection with nuclear, chemical or
  biological weapons, or missiles to deliver them, as set out in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009, as
  amended, and/or Articles 6, 7 and 8 of the Export Control Order 2008 (WMD purposes), then you should tell us of the
  circumstances and apply for a licence.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Restrictions not operated by the Export Control Organisation</h2>
<p>
  This application has not been assessed against other restrictions on exports (for example on antique goods or
  pharmaceutical products) not administered by ECO. Learn more about these
  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/starting-to-export" rel="noopener" target="_blank">restrictions that are not operated by the Export Control Organisation</a>.
</p>

<p>
  In addition you should be aware that there are significant restrictions on the transfer of funds and making economic
  resources available (including the supply of goods) to persons, entities or bodies which are listed in the EU
  sanctions legislation in respect of countries subject to UN or EU sanctions. Up-to-date details of these can be found
  in the Notices issued by HM Treasury which are posted in the web-link below. In addition, the UK financial sanctions
  against embargoed destinations are regularly reviewed and tightened by means of legislation issued by HM Treasury.
  These may include prohibitions on all financial transactions and business relationships between UK financial and
  credit institutions and banks incorporated in countries which are subject to sanctions. Whilst this legislation
  affects financial and credit institutions and does not directly restrict exports, it could make it harder for you to
  trade with the relevant embargoed destination/s, as your bank may not be able to handle payments from or to banks in
  the countries subject to these financial restrictions.

  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-sanctions-consolidated-list-of-targets" rel="noopener" target="_blank">who is subject to financial sanctions in the UK</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Where to find further information</h2>
<p>
  It is the responsibility of exporters to consult the current export control legislation, familiarise themselves with
  export controls and make their own evaluation of the need for export licences.

<p>
  Finally, if you require further advice regarding the measures referred to in this letter, including how any
  relevant export control legislation may apply to your particular case, we recommend that you seek independent legal
  advice.
</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
