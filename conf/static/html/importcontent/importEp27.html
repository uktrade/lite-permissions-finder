<p>
  You normally don't need a licence to import non-endangered live animals. You must however make sure that you follow
  animal welfare regulations in full at all times.
</p>

<p>
  You do need a licence to import any non-native animal to the UK - apply using

  Some live animals and birds are covered by a general import licence. See a

  you must follow all the conditions in the licence.
