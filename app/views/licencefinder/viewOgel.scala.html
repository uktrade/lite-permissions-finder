    Dear exporter
  </p>

  <p class="bold">
    Our Ref: @licenceInfo.getLicenceNumber
  </p>

  <p>
    Based on the choices you made on the online tool, you have registered to use the following Open General Licence (OGEL):
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="bold">Licence number:</span><br>@licenceInfo.getLicenceNumber
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">OGEL type:</span><br>Open General Export Licence (@licenceInfo.getLicenceType)
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="bold">Site:</span><br>@licenceInfo.getSiteAddress
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note you will not receive a hardcopy licence from the Export Control Organisation (ECO).
  </p>

  <p>
    Using SPIRE, you may now export goods and/or software/technology against this OGEL, provided that you:
  </p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>
      have downloaded and read carefully, a copy of the relevant licence and all the terms and conditions set out
      within the licence, and have met these in full. See our website for
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/open-general-export-licences-ogels" target="_blank">all OGELs<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span></a>
    </li>
    <li>
      include your licence number or OGEL type on supporting documentation accompanying the items you're exporting
      against this OGEL and in the records you keep
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Keep your business information up to date</h2>
  <p>
    You must update SPIRE if any of the business information you have registered on SPIRE changes.
  </p>

  <p>
    This means it's your responsibility on SPIRE to:
  </p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>
      upload new business information, such as business name, VAT registration number, or address at which records are
      kept
    </li>
    <li>
      register your OGEL under a new business
    </li>
    <li>
      de-register the OGEL under a previous business
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Find out how to
      <a href="https://www.spire.trade.gov.uk/docs/RegisterOGLs.pdf" target="_blank">
        update your business information (PDF)<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span>
      </a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You must upload your new business information onto SPIRE within 30 days of any changes to your business. Failure to
    do this will make your licence void.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">How to stay compliant</h2>
  <p>
    You can find guidance on best practice for effective compliance procedures and advice on strategic export controls
    in our
      <a href="https://www.gov.uk//government/publications/compliance-code-of-practice" target="_blank">
      'Compliance Code of Practice' document<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span>
    </a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compliance Inspectors may audit your records within 3-6 months of your registration to ensure your business
    complies with the terms and conditions of the licence you've used. You'll be notified if a visit is needed.

  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Restrictions not operated by the Export Control Organisation</h2>
  <p>
    Your application to register for an OGEL was not assessed against other restrictions on exports
    (for example on antique goods or pharmaceutical products) not administered by ECO. Learn more about these

    </a>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Make sure your licence is current</h2>
  <p>
    OGELs are subject to change and you must ensure that the licence you're using is current. You can ask to receive
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/notices-to-exporters" target="_blank">
      email notifications of any amendments to OGELs<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span>
    </a>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Where to find further information</h2>
  <p>
    It is the responsibility of exporters to consult the current export control legislation, familiarise themselves with
    export controls and make their own evaluation of the need for export licences.

    </a>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">How to access training</h2>
  <p>
    If you're unsure whether your goods, software or technology require a licence, you can receive training from the
    ECO. We run a number of training courses, seminars and workshops to help exporters understand their obligations
    under export control legislation. A charge is applied for this service. Find out about
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/export-control-training-bulletin" target="_blank">
      dates and details for forthcoming ECO training courses<span class="visually-hidden"> (opens in a new tab)</span>
    </a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, if you require further advice regarding the information in this letter, including how any relevant export
    control legislation may apply to your particular case, we recommend that you seek independent legal advice.

  <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
