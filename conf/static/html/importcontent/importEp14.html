<p>You only need a licence to import iron and steel if the materials are being sent from Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>It's not possible for this service to say for certain that you do not need a licence - it is still your responsibility to make sure.</p>

<p>If you still think you may need a licence, or for further advice on import controls, you can contact the
  Import Licensing Branch
  by email <a href="mailto:enquiries.ilb@bis.gsi.gov.uk">enquiries.ilb@bis.gsi.gov.uk</a> or by phone on 01642 364333.</p>
